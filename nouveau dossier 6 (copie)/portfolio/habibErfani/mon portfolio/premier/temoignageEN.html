                Many good memories at the IUT of Montpellier,
                where I was able to learn and develop a lot of skills around IT.

            <p class="tex">
                If I were honest, I would say that I spent more time at home than at the IUT of Montpellier.
                But above all, it's 3 good years with good times,
                in a perfect borderline setting. I highly recommend this course and this city.

            <p class="tex">            
                I can say without shame that the years I spent at IUT were those where I enjoyed learning the most!
                The best part about this story is that the vast majority of this knowledge is useful to me today in the professional world.

            <p class="tex">

                The DUT in computer science provided me with quality education with a balance between theoretical and technical knowledge,
                I still consider today that it is the best training to start a career in the computer world so much
                the variety of themes and technologies discussed opens doors to multiple sectors.

            <p class="tex">
                I discovered the IT department of IUT after an open house, my interest in this section was made by seeing the projects carried out by the students.
                I very quickly decided to go this route because I didn't really have any other ideas.
                So I went to the IUT with some trepidation on the first day.

                Very quickly I was won over by the openness of the students in the department and was able to find a place easily.
                The presence of very varied courses outside of programming courses (communication, mathematics, economics ...) gave me an even more precise idea of ​​my post-DUT orientation.
                A very reassuring feeling.

                The presence of non-computer courses might discourage some, but in reality it is an opportunity.
                I am now at the end of the second year of IUT Informatique, and I can say that all these subjects greatly facilitate professional integration or the pursuit of studies.
                In addition, despite these subjects, courses and tutorials in computer science predominate and allow the acquisition of broad skills.

                The first year in IUT is accessible without having ever programmed before. In my case I had barely programmed.
                I was able to quickly adapt to the pace of the lessons, which are all very well formulated.

                IT is an ever-growing field, which is why I encourage you to take an interest in the IT department, which will undoubtedly open the doors to the profession that you like.
